How to Install and Configure CSF on AlmaLinux 9
====================================================



ConfigServer Security & Firewall (CSF) is an iptables-based firewall 
that provides high-level security to the Linux system.

CSF includes a wide range of features, 
        such as IP blocking, 
        port blocking, and 
        DoS protection. 


It also supports advanced security measures, 
        such as rate limiting, 
        connection tracking, 
        and SSH login detection. 

In addition to its firewall features, CSF includes tools for 
        system and file integrity checking, 
        as well as email and login tracking.


Step 1: Update Operating System
-------------------------------------

# dnf install epel-release
# dnf update
# dnf install wget nano tar



Step 2: Disable firewalld and any other iptables firewall
-------------------------------------
# systemctl stop firewalld
# systemctl disable firewalld



Step 3: Install Required Perl Modules for CSF
-----------------------------------------------

Install the following Perl modules required by CSF.

# dnf install perl-libwww-perl.noarch perl-LWP-Protocol-https.noarch perl-GDGraph
# yum install perl-Math-BigInt wget nano tar



Step 4: Download CSF
------------------------------------
# cd /mnt
# wget https://download.configserver.com/csf.tgz
# tar -xzf csf.tgz
# cd csf
# sh install.sh


Then you can check the iptables mode using below command.
----------------------------------------------------------
# perl /usr/local/csf/bin/csftest.pl


            You should see the following output:
            
            Testing ip_tables/iptable_filter…OK
            Testing ipt_LOG…OK
            Testing ipt_multiport/xt_multiport…OK
            Testing ipt_REJECT…OK
            Testing ipt_state/xt_state…OK
            Testing ipt_limit/xt_limit…OK
            Testing ipt_recent…OK
            Testing xt_connlimit…OK
            Testing ipt_owner/xt_owner…OK
            Testing iptable_nat/ipt_REDIRECT…OK
            Testing iptable_nat/ipt_DNAT…OK
            
            RESULT: csf should function on this server




Step 5: Configuring the CSF
------------------------------------
CSF runs in TEST mode by default. 
To disable it, you need to edit the /etc/csf/csf.conf file.

# nano /etc/csf/csf.conf

Locate the line TESTING = 1 and change the value to 0 or 
else LFD daemon fail to start.

      TESTING = "0"


Locate the line RESTRICT_SYSLOG = 0 and change its value to 3. 
This means only members of the RESTRICT_SYSLOG_GROUP can access the syslog/rsyslog files.

    RESTRICT_SYSLOG = "3"


Also, you can allow incoming and outgoing port as per your requirement:

# Allow incoming TCP ports
TCP_IN = "20,21,22,25,53,80,110,143,443,465,587,993,995"

# Allow outgoing TCP ports
TCP_OUT = "20,21,22,25,53,80,110,113,443,587,993,995"



Once your done all the configuration, restart and enable CSF:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        # systemctl restart csf && systemctl restart lfd
        # systemctl enable csf && systemctl enable lfd
        # systemctl status csf && systemctl status lfd



Step 6: Enable CSF GUI
------------------------------------
By default, it is disabled in the CSF default configuration file, so 
you will need to enable it first. For enabling CSF GUI you need to 
setup Integrated User Interface section in csf.conf configuration file.

Open the CSF main configuration file with the following command:

# nano /etc/csf/csf.conf
Change the following lines:

      ###############################################################################
      # SECTION:Integrated User Interface
      ###############################################################################

            # 1 to enable, 0 to disable web ui 
            UI = "1"
            
            # Set port for web UI. The default port is 6666. 
            UI_PORT = "8888"
            
            # Leave blank to bind to all IP addresses on the server 
            UI_IP = ""
            
            # Set username for authetnication 
            UI_USER = "admin"
            
            # Set a strong password for authetnication 
            UI_PASS = "Test@12345"
            Next you need to allow the IP from where you are going to access CSF GUI. You can either allow the entire subnet or you can also choose to allow some specific IP Address like below.
            
            # echo "YOUR_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS" >>  /etc/csf/ui/ui.allow





Then restart the CSF and LFD service to apply the changes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
# systemctl restart csf
# systemctl restart lfd





Step 7: Access CSF Web Interface
------------------------------------
Open your web browser and type the URL 
        https://your-server-IP:8888 
You will be redirected to the CSF login page:






Step: 8: Manage CSF with Command Line
------------------------------------
        To list all firewall rules, run the following command:
        
        # csf -l
        To stop CSF, run the following command:
        
        # csf -s
        To allow a specific IP address, run the following command:
        
        # csf -a IP-address
        To deny an IP address, run the following command:
        
        # csf -d IP-address
        To remove blocked IP address from a CSF rule, run the following command:
        
        # csf -dr IP-address
        To verify whether the IP address is blocked or not, run the following command:
        
        # csf -g IP-address
        To flush the CSF firewall rules, run the following command:
        
        # csf -f
        To disable CSF, run the following command:
        
        # csf -x
        Step 9: Uninstall CSF and LFD on AlmaLinux
        Run the following script to remove CSF and LFD from your system.
        
        # sh /etc/csf/uninstall.sh
        List of Important CSF Configuration Files
        Below are the important configuration files that control the most of the rules in the CSF.






        csf.conf – the main configuration file, it has helpful comments
        explaining what each option does
        
        
        csf.allow – a list of IP’s and CIDR addresses that should always
        be allowed through the firewall
        
        
        csf.deny – a list of IP’s and CIDR addresses that should never
        be allowed through the firewall
        
        
        csf.ignore – a list of IP’s and CIDR addresses that lfd should 
        ignore and not not block if detected
        
        csf.*ignore – various ignore files that list files, users, IP’s that 
        lfd should ignore. See each file for their specific purpose and tax




----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you manually modify these files, you will need to restart csf and 
then lfd them to take effect.
